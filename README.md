# RoidVisualizer
A GPS Visualizer for SpaceEngineers made in Unity 5.

After awhile of sending GPS coordinates over steam chat, my faction in SE started using Google Sheets to help us organize and stockpile our info on the world. However, just looking at the coordinates, you couldn't tell distance, relation, or even which direction to go to reach your destination. If there was enemy territory, you couldn't be sure your path wouldn't intersect, or if some of your asteroids were owned by another faction.

I started off with making a simple parser for unity, something that I could see where things in our huge list of points were without flying really far away from the base. Then I started adding more features. 

At it's current state, you can be set up in less than 5 minutes with an interface for your collaborative sheet, that updates itself while your faction members add info. 

Enjoy! 

P.S. Keep in mind, I would very much appreciate both bug reports and suggestions, maybe even a little critiscism. Thank you!
